<p>Termites can cause extensive damage to the structure of a building if they are not managed or controlled by qualified pest professionals such as Pesteco.</p>

<p>Densely populated areas, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide, face a greater risk due to the large concentration of buildings and associated climate.</p>

<h2>How do you know if you have Termites?</h2>

<p>Because Termites mostly live underground and in the walls of your home, you are unlikely to see the termites themselves. Signs may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Termite droppings, which look like small, ridged, wood-colored pellets.</li>
  <li>Mud tubes on exterior surface</li>
  <li>Wings all of the same size (look like tiny fish scales) shredded near an entry point to your home</li>
  <li>Since some of these signs are difficult to detect, we recommend regular inspection by a Pesteco pest-control professional</li>
</ul>
