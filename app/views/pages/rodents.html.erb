<p>Rodents, birds and critter pests are well known for spreading disease and health risks. They are also able to cause considerable damage to property and pose a genuine fire risk with their habit of disrupting cables, wiring and guttering.</p>

<p>Infestations can cost you and your business time, health and money. A quick response at the very first signs of an infestation is often essential to control rodent and bird infestations and to prevent the spread of disease and property damage.</p>

<h2>Identify the signs of a rodent infestation</h2>
<p>There are over 60 species of rats in Australia with the widespread and abundant brown, black or sewer rat most commonly responsible for infestations in houses, businesses, restaurants, warehouses and storage areas.</p>
<p>Areas in Australia most at risk include greater metro areas and inner suburbs across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.</p>
<p>Warmer weather, population growth and the proliferation of restaurants and cafes are creating perfect conditions for rodents to spread.</p>
<p>It is important to identify the signs of rodent infestations early. Such signs can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rodent droppings</strong> left behind in kitchen cabinets, pantries, cupboards, drawers, sinks and other food areas;</li>
  <li><strong>Urine pools</strong> or trails sometimes found leading to dirt mounds;</li>
  <li><strong>Nesting material</strong> such as shredded paper, fabric, or dried plant matter; </li>
  <li><strong>Chew marks</strong> on food packaging, containers or wires;</li>
  <li><strong>Squeaks and noises</strong> which are more apparent in evenings; and</li>
  <li><strong>Stale smells</strong> coming from hidden areas.</li>
</ul>
